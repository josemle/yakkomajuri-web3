# Smart Contract Template Repository

This repository contains a collection of various smart contracts for decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, token standards, and voting mechanisms. These smart contracts are written in Solidity and Move language and are intended to serve as templates for developers building on blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Aptos.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a set of reusable smart contract templates for DeFi, governance, and token-related use cases. The contracts included are designed to be modular, secure, and optimized for blockchain development on platforms like **Ethereum**, **Binance Smart Chain**, **Polygon**, **Aptos**, and others.

These templates are also useful for educational purposes, learning about different smart contract patterns, and testing common functionalities in blockchain development.

## Smart Contracts Included

### DeFi Contracts
1. **Liquidity Pool Contract** (Ethereum & Aptos)
   - A decentralized liquidity pool for swapping assets.
   - Implements automated market-making (AMM) algorithms similar to Uniswap or SushiSwap.

2. **Staking Contract** (Ethereum & Aptos)
   - Enables users to stake tokens and earn rewards.
   - Includes functionality for reward distribution, stake withdrawal, and penalty mechanisms.

3. **Lending/Borrowing Contract** (Ethereum & Aptos)
   - Allows users to lend their tokens for interest or borrow tokens against collateral.
   - Implements interest rate models, liquidation mechanisms, and loan repayments.

4. **Yield Farming Contract** (Ethereum)
   - Rewards users for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
   - Distributes governance tokens or rewards based on liquidity provided and time staked.

### Token Contracts
1. **ERC20 Token Contract** (Ethereum)
   - The standard implementation of the ERC20 token.
   - Includes basic functions such as transfer, balance, and approval.

2. **ERC721 Token Contract** (Ethereum)
   - A non-fungible token (NFT) contract that supports minting and transferring unique assets.
   - Used for digital collectibles, gaming assets, or ownership records.

3. **Move Fungible Asset Contract** (Aptos)
   - A Move-based implementation of a fungible token on the Aptos blockchain.
   - Includes the ability to create, transfer, and burn tokens.

4. **Move Non-Fungible Asset Contract** (Aptos)
   - A Move-based implementation of a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Aptos blockchain.
   - Supports unique token minting and transfers.

### Voting Contracts
1. **Simple Voting Contract** (Ethereum & Aptos)
   - Allows users to vote on a proposal with yes/no options.
   - The results are visible to everyone once the voting period ends.

2. **Token-weighted Voting Contract** (Ethereum)
   - A voting contract where votes are weighted based on token holdings.
   - Useful for governance in decentralized organizations (DAOs).

3. **Multi-Option Voting Contract** (Ethereum)
   - A contract that allows voting on multiple options in a single proposal.
   - Supports ranked-choice voting or simple plurality voting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with the contracts in this repository, you need:
- **Node.js** installed for development and testing (for Ethereum-based contracts).
- **Aptos CLI** and a working development environment for Move-based contracts.
- **Truffle** or **Hardhat** for Ethereum-based smart contract deployment.
- **Metamask** or any compatible wallet to interact with the contracts on the Ethereum network or testnets.

### Install Dependencies

1. **Ethereum Contracts**:  
   In the root directory of the repository, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
